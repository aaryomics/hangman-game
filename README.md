# Hangman game
A modern, visually engaging adaptation of the classic Hangman game — designed with a soft, pastel aesthetic and flower-themed mechanics. Instead of drawing a figure, this version gently removes flower petals with each incorrect guess, providing a calm yet challenging gameplay experience.

✨ Features
- Clean pixel-art style background and assets
- Interactive on-screen keyboard
- Progressive petal disappearance for incorrect attempts
- Contextual hints as the player nears the final guess
- Optional sound effects to enhance user interaction
- A curated vocabulary of gentle, theme-aligned words

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external frameworks — lightweight, responsive, and fully client-side.
